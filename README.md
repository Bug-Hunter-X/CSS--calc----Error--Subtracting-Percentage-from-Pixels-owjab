# CSS `calc()` Error: Subtracting Percentage from Pixels

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS: attempting to subtract a percentage from a pixel value.  This often leads to unexpected results or errors in different browsers.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected version.

This is a simple example, but the principle applies to more complex `calc()` expressions. Always ensure that your units are consistent within the `calc()` function.
