The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `calc()` function is used incorrectly to calculate the width of an element.  The calculation attempts to subtract a percentage from a pixel value, resulting in unexpected behavior or an error in some browsers.

```css
div {
  width: calc(300px - 50%);
}
```
