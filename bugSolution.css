The solution is to ensure consistent units within the `calc()` function.  Instead of subtracting a percentage from a pixel value, we can either calculate the pixel value of 50% relative to the parent element or change the subtraction to use pixels.

Here's a corrected version:

```css
div {
  /* Option 1: Calculate 50% based on parent */
  width: calc(300px - 50vw); 
  /* Option 2: use pixels */
  /* width: calc(300px - 150px); /* Assuming parent width is 300px */ */
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Option 1:** Uses `vw` (viewport width), a unit relative to the viewport.  This allows for subtracting a percentage representing the viewport width from the fixed pixel value. 
* **Option 2:** Directly uses a pixel value.  This requires knowing the intended value for the percentage or using a calculation to determine it in advance.
